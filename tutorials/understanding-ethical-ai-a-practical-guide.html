                      <h2>Fundamental Concepts of Ethical AI</h2>
                      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550000000000-4bd374c3f58b?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Illustration for Fundamental Concepts of Ethical AI" class="section-image">
                      <p># Fundamental Concepts of Ethical AI</p><p>Understanding the fundamental concepts of ethical AI is crucial for developing systems that are not only technically proficient but also align with societal values and norms. This section delves into what ethics in AI means, outlines key ethical principles, and explores issues related to AI bias and discrimination.</p><p>## 1. Definition of Ethics in AI</p><p>Ethics in AI refers to a set of principles and practices that guide the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies in a manner that respects human rights and dignity. Ethical AI aims to ensure that these technologies contribute positively to society, avoiding harm and benefiting humanity broadly. This involves considerations of how AI systems are designed, what data they are trained on, how they are used, and the potential impacts they have on individuals and society.</p><p>### Practical Example:</p><p>Consider a healthcare AI designed to diagnose diseases from medical imaging. An ethically designed AI system would need to ensure it does not perpetuate existing health disparities or bias towards certain groups. It should be validated across diverse demographic groups to ensure its decisions are fair and beneficial to all patients.</p><p>## 2. Key Ethical Principles</p><p>Three core principles often guide the discussion around ethical AI: fairness, accountability, and transparency. Each plays a crucial role in building trust and legitimacy in AI systems.</p><p>### Fairness</p><p>Fairness in AI means that algorithms should not create or reinforce unfair discrimination against individuals or groups. Ensuring fairness often involves identifying and mitigating biases that can occur due to skewed data or flawed algorithmic design.</p><p><strong>Code Example: Measuring Fairness</strong></p><p><code></code>`python<br>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score</p><p># Predictions might be less accurate for one group compared to another<br>y_pred = model.predict(X_test)<br>y_pred_minority = model.predict(X_test_minority)</p><p>print("Overall Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))<br>print("Minority Group Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test_minority, y_pred_minority))<br><code></code>`</p><p>This simple code snippet highlights how developers might begin to evaluate fairness in terms of predictive accuracy across different demographic groups.</p><p>### Accountability</p><p>Accountability in AI refers to the obligation of AI developers and deployers to be responsible for the outcomes of their AI systems. This includes mechanisms for redress if AI systems cause harm, and ensuring that there are processes in place for public and regulatory oversight.</p><p>### Transparency</p><p>Transparency involves both the ability to understand how AI systems work (often referred to as "explainability") and ensuring that information about AI practices is openly shared with relevant stakeholders. This openness builds trust and enables informed decision-making by users affected by AI technologies.</p><p><strong>Practical Tip:</strong> Implementing model-agnostic methods like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can help in enhancing the transparency of complex models.</p><p>## 3. Overview of AI Bias and Discrimination</p><p>AI systems can inadvertently become biased, leading to discrimination if not carefully checked. Bias can enter through various channels:</p><p>- <strong>Data Bias</strong>: Occurs when the training data used by an AI system is not representative of the broader population or contains historical biases.<br>- <strong>Algorithmic Bias</strong>: Can happen when the algorithms processing the data learn to replicate or accentuate biases present in the training data.</p><p>### Practical Example:</p><p>Imagine a job screening AI that learns from historical hiring data. If this data reflects a bias against a particular gender or ethnicity, the AI may also learn to favor certain candidates over others, perpetuating these biases.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Mitigating Bias:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Diverse Data Sets</strong>: Ensure training data encompasses a broad spectrum of individuals.<br>2. <strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Conduct periodic checks to assess whether the AI system is performing fairly across all user groups.<br>3. <strong>Bias Mitigation Algorithms</strong>: Deploy techniques specifically designed to reduce bias at both the data and algorithmic level.</p><p>### Conclusion</p><p>Building ethical AI systems is not merely a technical challenge but a societal imperative. By adhering to the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency, and by actively working to recognize and mitigate biases, developers can contribute to more just and equitable technological futures. This section has outlined foundational concepts in ethical AI, providing both theoretical insights and practical advice on navigating these complex waters.</p>

                      <p># Ethical Data Handling in AI</p><p>In the development of ethical AI systems, handling data responsibly is crucial. This section of the tutorial delves into best practices for data collection, ensuring data privacy and security, and managing sensitive information. By adhering to these practices, AI practitioners can uphold the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency in their projects.</p><p>## 1. Data Collection Best Practices</p><p>### The Foundation of Ethical AI</p><p>Ethical data collection is the cornerstone of building AI systems that are fair and unbiased. It involves not only how data is gathered but also considering what data is collected and from whom.</p><p>#### <strong>Consent and Transparency</strong></p><p>Always obtain informed consent from individuals whose data is being collected. Explain how their data will be used, ensuring transparency. This can be achieved through clear communication and privacy notices.</p><p>Example:<br><code></code>`python<br># Example of logging consent status in a data collection app<br>def log_consent(user_id, consent_status):<br>    print(f"Logging consent for user {user_id}: {'Consented' if consent_status else 'Not Consented'}")<br><code></code>`</p><p>#### <strong>Diversity and Representativeness</strong></p><p>Ensure the dataset represents the diversity of the population to avoid biases. This includes diversity in age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and more.</p><p>Example:<br><code></code>`python<br># Analyzing dataset for diversity metrics<br>def check_diversity(dataframe):<br>    return {<br>        'gender_diversity': dataframe['gender'].value_counts(normalize=True),<br>        'age_diversity': dataframe['age'].value_counts(bins=[0, 18, 35, 65, 100], normalize=True)<br>    }<br><code></code>`</p><p>#### <strong>Avoiding Data Bias</strong></p><p>Actively seek to identify and mitigate biases in the data collection process. This might involve revising data collection methods or sourcing additional data to balance the dataset.</p><p>### Practical Tip:<br>Regularly review data collection strategies and update them as needed to meet ethics guidelines and improve the representativeness and accuracy of your datasets.</p><p>## 2. Ensuring Data Privacy and Security</p><p>### Protecting Information Integrity</p><p>Data privacy and security are pivotal in maintaining trust and safeguarding against misuse of information. </p><p>#### <strong>Implementing Robust Security Measures</strong></p><p>Use encryption, secure data storage solutions, and access controls to protect data integrity and confidentiality.</p><p>Example:<br><code></code>`python<br># Example of encrypting a piece of data using Fernet encryption<br>from cryptography.fernet import Fernet<br>key = Fernet.generate_key()<br>cipher_suite = Fernet(key)<br>encrypted_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"Sensitive Information")<br>print(encrypted_text)<br><code></code>`</p><p>#### <strong>Regular Audits and Compliance Checks</strong></p><p>Conduct regular security audits and ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, depending on the geographical location and industry.</p><p>#### <strong>Anonymization Techniques</strong></p><p>When possible, anonymize datasets to protect individual identities. Techniques such as k-anonymity or differential privacy can be employed.</p><p>Example:<br><code></code>`python<br># Example of applying k-anonymity<br>import pandas as pd<br>data = pd.DataFrame({<br>    'age': [25, 30, 34, 29],<br>    'salary': [60000, 65000, 70000, 71000]<br>})<br>data['age'] = data['age'].apply(lambda x: (x // 10) * 10)  # Generalizing age<br>print(data)<br><code></code>`</p><p>### Practical Tip:<br>Design your AI systems with privacy by design principles from the outset rather than as an afterthought. This approach ensures privacy considerations are integrated into every aspect of your system development lifecycle.</p><p>## 3. Handling Sensitive Information</p><p>### Special Care for Sensitive Data</p><p>Sensitive information such as health records, personal identifiers, or financial information requires extra precautions beyond standard practices.</p><p>#### <strong>Data Access Restrictions</strong></p><p>Limit access to sensitive data based on roles and responsibilities. Implement strict authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.</p><p>#### <strong>Secure Data Transfer</strong></p><p>Ensure that data shared across networks is transmitted securely using encrypted communication protocols like HTTPS or secure FTP.</p><p>#### <strong>Data Minimization Principle</strong></p><p>Collect only the data necessary for the specific purpose and retain it only as long as needed to fulfill that purpose.</p><p>Example:<br><code></code>`python<br># Example of role-based access control (RBAC)<br>def access_data(user_role):<br>    if user_role in ['Administrator', 'Healthcare Provider']:<br>        print("Access Granted")<br>    else:<br>        print("Access Denied")<br><code></code>`</p><p>### Practical Tip:<br>Conduct sensitivity assessments periodically to determine if the data being handled appropriately aligns with its sensitivity level. Adjust controls as necessary to maintain high standards of protection.</p><p>## Conclusion</p><p>By adhering to these best practices in ethical data handling, AI practitioners can ensure their systems are not only effective but also respectful of privacy and rights. It's crucial that these systems are built on a foundation of trust and accountability, reinforcing the commitment to ethical AI.<br></p>

                      <h2>Designing Ethically Aligned AI Models</h2>
                      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550000002000-4bd374c3f58b?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Illustration for Designing Ethically Aligned AI Models" class="section-image">
                      <p># Designing Ethically Aligned AI Models</p><p>In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), ensuring that ethical principles guide AI development is crucial. This section of our tutorial focuses on the integration of ethics into AI design, techniques for mitigating bias, and ethical considerations in specific use cases such as facial recognition technology.</p><p>## 1. Integrating Ethics into AI Design</p><p>The integration of ethics into AI design begins at the conceptual stage and continues throughout the development process. Ethical AI is built on the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency. These principles ensure that AI systems perform without unintended bias and with respect for human dignity.</p><p>### Practical Steps for Ethical Integration:</p><p>- <strong>Define Ethical Goals Early</strong>: Establish clear ethical guidelines at the start of an AI project. For instance, if creating a hiring algorithm, define what fairness means in this context and how it will be measured.<br>- <strong>Interdisciplinary Teams</strong>: Include ethicists, sociologists, and legal experts in your development teams to provide diverse perspectives on the potential impacts of AI.<br>- <strong>Ethics Training</strong>: Provide regular ethics training for your AI developers to sensitize them to the ethical dimensions of their work.</p><p><code></code>`python<br># Example: Setting up an ethics checklist for an AI project<br>ethics_checklist = {<br>    "fairness": "Define and measure fairness across diverse demographics",<br>    "accountability": "Establish mechanisms for tracing decision-making",<br>    "transparency": "Ensure that AI systems can explain decisions in understandable terms"<br>}<br>print("Ethics Checklist:", ethics_checklist)<br><code></code>`</p><p>By embedding ethical considerations from the beginning, AI developers can anticipate and mitigate ethical risks.</p><p>## 2. Techniques to Mitigate Bias in AI Models</p><p>Bias in AI models can lead to unfair outcomes, which may affect people's lives significantly. Mitigating bias is therefore a critical component of ethical AI development.</p><p>### Techniques Include:</p><p>- <strong>Data Audit</strong>: Conduct thorough audits of your data sets for historical biases or imbalances. Adjustments or augmentation might be necessary to ensure representative data.<br>- <strong>Algorithmic Fairness Approaches</strong>: Implement mathematical frameworks that aim to ensure fairness, such as equal opportunity or demographic parity.<br>- <strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: Regularly review AI outcomes for signs of emerging biases and adjust models as necessary.</p><p><code></code>`python<br># Example: Implementing a fairness constraint in model training<br>from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression<br>from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity</p><p># Load your dataset<br>X_train, y_train = load_your_data()</p><p># Set up the fairness constraint<br>constraint = DemographicParity()</p><p># Train a fair model<br>mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(LogisticRegression(), constraint)<br>mitigator.fit(X_train, y_train)</p><p>print("Trained a model with demographic parity constraint")<br><code></code>`</p><p>Adopting these techniques helps in building trust with users by demonstrating commitment to fairness.</p><p>## 3. Use Case: Ethical Considerations in Facial Recognition Technology</p><p>Facial recognition technology showcases both the potential benefits and ethical challenges of AI. While beneficial for security or personalization services, it raises significant concerns related to privacy, consent, and bias.</p><p>### Ethical Considerations Include:</p><p>- <strong>Consent</strong>: Ensure that individuals are aware of and consent to their data being used for facial recognition.<br>- <strong>Bias Mitigation</strong>: Facial recognition systems have been criticized for higher error rates for certain demographic groups. Rigorous testing across diverse groups is essential.<br>- <strong>Transparency</strong>: Provide clear information about how facial recognition data is used, stored, and protected.</p><p><code></code>`python<br># Example: Ensuring fairness in facial recognition models<br>from your_facial_recognition_package import FacialRecognitionModel</p><p>model = FacialRecognitionModel()<br>model.train(data)<br>model.test(data_test)</p><p># Evaluate fairness across different demographics<br>fairness_report = model.evaluate_fairness(criteria="equal_accuracy")<br>print(fairness_report)<br><code></code>`</p><p>Developers must consider these factors to design facial recognition systems that respect user rights and prevent discriminatory outcomes.</p><p>## Conclusion</p><p>Designing ethically aligned AI models is not just a regulatory requirement but a responsibility towards society. By integrating ethics at the core of AI design, employing techniques to mitigate bias, and carefully considering the implications in applications like facial recognition technology, developers can contribute to a future where AI supports beneficial outcomes for all. Engaging with ethical AI practices leads to more sustainable and widely accepted AI solutions.</p>

                      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550000003000-4bd374c3f58b?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Illustration for Transparency and Accountability in AI Systems" class="section-image">
                      <p># Transparency and Accountability in AI Systems</p><p>In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensuring that systems are transparent and accountable is crucial for maintaining public trust and adhering to ethical guidelines. This section of the tutorial delves into practical approaches to enhance transparency and accountability in AI deployments, particularly focusing on tools for model explainability, setting up audit trails, and a case study on implementing explainable AI in financial services.</p><p>## 1. Tools for Model Explainability</p><p>Model explainability refers to the methods and tools used to describe and present an AI model's behaviors or predictions in understandable terms to humans. This is a cornerstone of ethical AI, fostering trust and fairness by allowing users and stakeholders to understand how decisions are made.</p><p>### Popular Tools and Techniques:</p><p>- <strong>LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)</strong>: LIME helps in explaining predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model.<br>- <strong>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)</strong>: SHAP leverages the concept of game theory to explain the output of any machine learning model. It provides insights into the contribution of each feature in making a prediction.</p><p>#### Example Usage of SHAP:</p><p><code></code>`python<br>import shap<br>import xgboost as xgb<br>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split<br>from sklearn.datasets import load_boston</p><p># Load data<br>X, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)<br>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)</p><p># Train a model<br>model = xgb.XGBRegressor()<br>model.fit(X_train, y_train)</p><p># Explain the model's predictions using SHAP<br>explainer = shap.Explainer(model)<br>shap_values = explainer(X_test)</p><p># Visualize the first prediction's explanation<br>shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])<br><code></code>`</p><p>### Best Practices:<br>- Regularly update your explanation methods to align with new research and data changes.<br>- Ensure that explanations are accessible to all stakeholders, not just data scientists.</p><p>## 2. Setting Up Audit Trails for AI Decisions</p><p>Audit trails are vital for accountability in AI systems. They provide a historical record of decisions made by the AI, allowing for review and analysis to ensure compliance with ethical standards.</p><p>### Implementing Audit Trails:</p><p>- <strong>Logging Decisions</strong>: Store logs of all decisions made by the AI system along with relevant input data and decision outcomes.<br>- <strong>Version Control</strong>: Use version control systems to manage changes in the AI model, including adjustments to data, algorithms, and parameters.</p><p>#### Example of Setting Up Logging with Python:</p><p><code></code>`python<br>import logging</p><p># Setup logging configuration<br>logging.basicConfig(filename='ai_decision_log.txt', level=logging.INFO,<br>                    format='%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(message)s')</p><p>def log_decision(input_data, output_data):<br>    logging.info(f"Input Data: {input_data}, Output Data: {output_data}")</p><p># Example usage<br>input_data = {'customer_id': 123, 'transaction_amount': 100}<br>output_data = {'approval_status': 'approved'}<br>log_decision(input_data, output_data)<br><code></code>`</p><p>### Best Practices:<br>- Ensure logs are secure and tamper-proof to maintain the integrity of data.<br>- Regularly audit the AI systems and logs to detect anomalies or biases.</p><p>## 3. Case Study: Implementing Explainable AI in Financial Services</p><p>Financial services stand to benefit greatly from AI in terms of efficiency and decision-making but also face significant risks related to bias and transparency. A leading bank implemented an AI system for credit scoring using techniques like LIME and SHAP for model explainability.</p><p>### Implementation Overview:</p><p>- <strong>Model Choice</strong>: The bank used a gradient boosting model due to its effectiveness in handling diverse types of data.<br>- <strong>Explainability Tools Used</strong>: SHAP was used to understand feature contributions in each credit scoring decision.<br>- <strong>Outcome</strong>: Transparency improved customer trust, while regulators were provided detailed explanations for auditing purposes.</p><p>### Lessons Learned:<br>- Regular feedback loops between model developers, users, and stakeholders can enhance trust and effectiveness.<br>- Continuous monitoring and updating of models are necessary to adapt to new patterns in data.</p><p>By integrating tools for model explainability and setting up comprehensive audit trails, AI systems in financial services can not only comply with regulations but also gain trust from customers and stakeholders. This proactive approach towards transparency and accountability is essential as we advance further into the age of ethical AI.</p>

                      <h2>Implementing Ethical AI: Practical Examples and Code Samples</h2>
                      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550000004000-4bd374c3f58b?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Illustration for Implementing Ethical AI: Practical Examples and Code Samples" class="section-image">
                      <p># Implementing Ethical AI: Practical Examples and Code Samples</p><p>In this section of our tutorial on "Understanding Ethical AI: A Practical Guide," we will delve into practical applications and coding practices that align with ethical AI principles. We'll explore how to build transparent recommendation systems, implement fairness in AI models, particularly focusing on a loan approval context, and discuss best practices for code documentation and ethical review processes. These examples and practices are designed to help intermediate-level practitioners integrate ethics into their AI solutions effectively.</p><p>## 1. Example: Building a Transparent Recommendation System</p><p>### Understanding Transparency in AI<br>Transparency in AI involves creating systems that are understandable by humans, where the decisions made by these systems can be easily traced and justified. A transparent recommendation system not only suggests products or content to users but also provides clear reasons why these items are recommended.</p><p>### Practical Implementation<br>Consider a movie recommendation system. A transparent approach would involve not only suggesting movies to a user but also providing reasons for these recommendations. This could be based on matching the user's viewing history with similar tastes of other users (collaborative filtering) or by suggesting movies that feature favorite actors or genres (content-based filtering).</p><p>#### Code Sample:<br><code></code>`python<br>import pandas as pd<br>from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity</p><p># Sample data<br>data = {'User': ['User1', 'User2', 'User3'],<br>        'Action': [5, 1, 2],<br>        'Comedy': [2, 4, 5],<br>        'Drama': [3, 5, 1]}</p><p>df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index('User')</p><p># Compute similarity between users<br>similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(df)<br>similarity_df = pd.DataFrame(similarity_matrix, columns=df.index, index=df.index)</p><p># Function to recommend movies and explain why<br>def recommend_movies(user, num_recommendations=2):<br>    similar_users = similarity_df[user].sort_values(ascending=False)[1:]<br>    top_users = similar_users.head(num_recommendations)<br>    recommendations = []<br>    for other_user in top_users.index:<br>        matched_preferences = df.columns[(df.loc[user] - df.loc[other_user]).abs() < 1].tolist()<br>        recommendations.append((other_user, matched_preferences))<br>    return recommendations</p><p># Example usage<br>user_recommendations = recommend_movies('User1')<br>print(f"Recommended based on similar users: {user_recommendations}")<br><code></code>`</p><p>### Explanation:<br>In the code above, we calculate the cosine similarity between users based on their ratings across different genres. Recommendations are made by identifying users with similar tastes and explaining the commonalities in their preferences. This transparency helps users understand why particular movies are recommended.</p><p>## 2. Code Sample: Implementing Fairness in Loan Approval Models</p><p>Fairness in AI is crucial, especially in sensitive applications like loan approvals. It ensures that decisions do not reflect biased judgments against certain groups based on gender, race, or other protected attributes.</p><p>### Code Implementation for Fairness<br>Here's how you might implement a simple fairness constraint in a loan approval predictive model using Python:</p><p>#### Code Sample:<br><code></code>`python<br>from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression<br>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split<br>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score</p><p># Sample data preparation<br>X = loan_data.drop('LoanApproved', axis=1)  # Predictor variables<br>y = loan_data['LoanApproved']  # Target variable</p><p># Split the dataset into training and test sets<br>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)</p><p># Create a logistic regression model<br>model = LogisticRegression()</p><p># Train the model<br>model.fit(X_train, y_train)</p><p># Predict on the test set<br>y_pred = model.predict(X_test)</p><p># Evaluate the model<br>print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))</p><p># Implementing fairness checks<br># Assume 'gender' is a column in your dataset<br>male_mask = (X_test['gender'] == 'Male')<br>female_mask = (X_test['gender'] == 'Female')</p><p>male_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test[male_mask], y_pred[male_mask])<br>female_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test[female_mask], y_pred[female_mask])</p><p>print("Male Accuracy:", male_accuracy)<br>print("Female Accuracy:", female_accuracy)</p><p># Check for fairness<br>assert abs(male_accuracy - female_accuracy) < 0.05  # Ensuring fairness by keeping accuracy difference minimal<br><code></code>`</p><p>### Explanation:<br>The above code ensures fairness by checking that the accuracy of loan approvals does not significantly differ between male and female applicants. This is a basic example, and real-world scenarios might require more sophisticated statistical techniques or fairness metrics.</p><p>## 3. Best Practices for Code Documentation and Ethical Review Processes</p><p>### Comprehensive Documentation<br>Good documentation is critical for maintaining ethical AI systems. It ensures that anyone reviewing or working with your code can understand its purpose, how it operates, and any ethical considerations it includes.</p><p>#### Tips for Effective Documentation:<br>- <strong>Comment liberally:</strong> Explain what each part of your code does.<br>- <strong>Use readable code:</strong> Name variables and functions clearly.<br>- <strong>Include ethical considerations:</strong> Document any decisions made to handle ethical dilemmas.</p><p>### Ethical Review Processes<br>An ethical review process involves regular checks and audits to ensure AI systems comply with ethics guidelines. This could include peer reviews, ethics committee assessments, and user feedback loops.</p><p>#### Implementing Reviews:<br>- <strong>Set up regular audits:</strong> Schedule periodic reviews to assess the ethical impact of your AI systems.<br>- <strong>Peer reviews:</strong> Encourage team members to review each other’s work focused on ethical implications.<br>- <strong>Feedback mechanisms:</strong> Allow users to report concerns or suggestions regarding AI behavior.</p><p>By integrating these practices, developers can better adhere to ethical AI principles, ensuring their systems are fair, accountable, and transparent.</p>
