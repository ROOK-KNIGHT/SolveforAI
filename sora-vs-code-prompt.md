## Troubleshooting Tips for SORA:

If the video is still too complex:

1. **Break into smaller segments:** Create separate 15-second videos for each major step
2. **Use simpler language:** "Show clicking the Download button on VS Code website"
3. **Focus on one action:** "Show downloading VS Code installer from website"
4. **Be more specific:** "Mouse cursor clicks blue Download button, file downloads to browser"

The key is being very specific about mouse movements and button clicks while keeping the overall concept simple.
